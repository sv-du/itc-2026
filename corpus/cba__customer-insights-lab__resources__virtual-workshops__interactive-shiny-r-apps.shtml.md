# Bring Data to Life: Create Interactive Apps with Shiny in R

## Bring Data to Life: Create Interactive Apps with Shiny in R

Discover how to transform your data into interactive web applications with Shiny, a powerful R package designed for creating dynamic user interfaces. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to build and customize Shiny apps, create reactive data visualizations using packages like ggplot2 and plotly, and deploy your apps online. Whether you're new to programming or an R user looking to expand your skills, this workshop will guide you step-by-step through the process of turning static data into engaging, interactive experiences. The workshop will be led by CCIDM’s Marketing Analytics specialist, Jarrod Griffin, who is also a student in the [Master of Science in Digital Marketing](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/graduate-business-programs/programs/master-degree-in-digital-marketing-and-marketing-analytics.shtml).

**Learning Outcomes**

1. **Understand Shiny App Structure:** Participants will learn the fundamental architecture of Shiny apps and how to structure code using ui.R/server.R or app.R.
2. **Implement Reactive Programming:** Attendees will gain the skills to create dynamic, interactive Shiny applications using reactive values and expressions.
3. **Build Interactive Data Visualizations:** Participants will learn to incorporate and customize interactive plots with packages like ggplot2 and plotly for responsive data visualization.
4. **Deploy Shiny Apps on Various Platforms:** Attendees will be able to deploy Shiny apps to platforms such as shinyapps.io and shinylive, making the apps accessible online.
5. **Secure Shiny Applications:** Participants will learn about securing Shiny apps, including implementing authentication and understanding best practices for protecting sensitive data.

  mutate(across(c("Date", "Revenue"), ~ str_extract(.x, "\\d+"))) %>%
  mutate(across(c("Date", "Revenue"), as.numeric)) %>%
  mutate(Post_Type = factor(Post_Type, levels = c("Featured Product", "Announcement", "Event Showcase", "Employee of the Week"))) %>%
  arrange(Date)

30:25:
selectInput("post_type", "Post Type:", choices = unique(post_data.df$Post_Type), multiple = TRUE),

35:07:
