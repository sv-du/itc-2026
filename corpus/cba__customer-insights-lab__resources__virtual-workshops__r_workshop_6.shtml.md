# R Workshop #6: Data Visualization with R

## Data Visualization with R

This final workshop will deal with visualizing data, using R’s built-in functions as well as popular packages such as ggplot2 and lattice. Specifically, participants will learn how to create the most appropriate chart when data involves one variable or two variables, categorical or continuous variables. We will progress from the simplest to the most sophisticated charts, by adding layers of specification systematically, to create the kind of quality charts that may appear in WSJ or the Economist.

[If you haven't installed R or RStudio, click here to learn how!](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/customer-insights-lab/news/event/install-r.shtml)

**Learning Outcomes**

1. Describe three popular packages that allow one to visualize data.
2. Explain the concept of the grammar of graphics when visualizing data with the ggplot2 package.
3. Create a chart when there is only one continuous variable or one categorical variable.
4. Create a chart when there are two variables where the dependent variable is continuous and the independent variable is either categorical or continuous.
5. Create a chart by adding a categorical moderator to the chart involving one variable or two variables.
6. Create a chart after filtering data using tidyverse functions.
