# Breadcrumb Setup

## Overview

Breadcrumbs allow a user to understand where they are in the hierarchy of a website and quickly navigate levels. For example, the [College of Science: Science Educational Enhancement Services (SEES)](https://www.cpp.edu/sci/sees/index.shtml) site needed to allow users to navigate back to the College of Science home page. The following is how to set up breadcrumbs for a site like SEES.

**Page View**

## Enabling Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs display only after the page is updated, submitted, and published with Show Breadcrumb = Yes. Subpages will automatically appear in the breadcrumb trail once their settings are enabled and published.

### Adding a Custom Breadcrumb

**Cascade View (Editing Mode)**

In Cascade, navigate to the target site (root folder) and select **Edit**.

![](img/breadcrumb-tutorial-cascade1.png)

The **parent site** is defined as the site directly above your current site. Enter the **Custom Breadcrumb Title** and **Custom Breadcrumb URL** for that parent site. Enter the **Display Name** for your current site, which will appear in the breadcrumb trail.

### Enabling Breadcrumbs on Individual Pages

You must enable breadcrumbs on every page where you want them to appear.

**Cascade View (Editing Mode)**

Navigate to the page where the breadcrumb should appear and select **Edit**.

**![](img/breadcrumb-tutorial-cascade3.png)**

Activate the breadcrumb functionality by choosing **Yes**. The breadcrumb will be rendered directly below the Page Heading.
